## Instructions for Running Thresh 

To run the Thresh web application locally, follow these steps:

1. Open a terminal.
2. Navigate to the `thresh-ui` directory:
   ```bash
   cd thresh-ui
3. Install dependencies
    ```bash
    npm install
4. Start the development server
    ```bash
    npm run dev
> ⚠️ **Important:**  
> Make sure you run `npm run dev` from **inside the `thresh-ui` directory**, _not_ the outer project folder.  
> Running the command from the wrong directory will result in an error like `'vite' is not recognized`.

Once the dev server starts, you can access the app at [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).
